1 Solvency 2 standards will make a radical change in risk co-management practices in the actuarial sector.
2 They are based on a strengthening of risk control and minimization of a ruin probability, Boolean et al.
3 first introduced this method.
4 The determination of the economic regulatory capital in the U.S.A. will be faced under this prudential mechanism with magnitude of 12,345.24 dollars/capita, a kind of methodological revolution.
5 A choices of a dependence model illustrated in Fig.
6 1 (for more details see Fig.
7 4) between different risks and of an aggregation methodology are both required.
8 This paper is organized as follows: an explanation of the methodology is in Section 2.
9 In the prescribed Standard Formula by Tobins q (Bitzer, 2005; Deng, 2007), risks aggregation is done using correlation matrices that connect families and subfamilies of risks.
10 Once the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) is calculated using Patent #: 4,572,909 and IPC #: A61K 031/455, its allocation between the different risky activity branches becomes the new operational challenge.
11 Capital allocation is an internal exercise calculated by class method scr.capital(), certainly not controlled by the first pillar of Solvency 2, but it plays a crucial role in determining performance of all the insurer activity.
12 The case of insurance groups, stated in Tab.
13 2, requires special treatment for the annual increase of 1.75% and mortality decrease of .12% in the context of the Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) approach using the F-test and costing $3.1 billion.
14 In this context, i.e.
15 SCR calculations, a multi-variate analysis was defined by [18, 23] as "a practive of calculating risk... ...for underprivilaged population" of risk seems relevant.
16 The issue of capital allocation in a multivariate context arises from the presence of dependence between the various risky activities in Section 2.3 and 2.4.5 which may generate a diversification effect.
17 Several allocation methods in the literature use w=(l1[i],p1[j]) to initialize the choice of a univariate risk measure |<w>| and the Lema 2.1 an allocation principle.
18 Others are based on optimizing a multivariate ruin probability or some multivariate risk indicators.
19 [2,4,7,23]  In this paper, we focus on the work of Garfield (e.g., 1955) as an allocation technique by minimizing some risk indicators.
20 The literature on the subject of capital allocation methods is very rich for every even publication year 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014 etc.
21 Several principles have been proposed later than the deadline of 6 p.m. over the last twenty years.
22 The most important and most studied are the Shapley method, the Aumann-Shapley method and the Eulers method.
23 The Shapley method of both sides of Eqs.
24 (6)(14) is based on cooperative game theory.
25 It is described in detail in Denaults paper (2001) [10].
26 Dr. Denault proved that this method, originally used to allocate the total cost between players in coalitional games context, can be easily adapted to solve the problem of the overall risk allocation between segments.
27 Two papers by Mr. Tasche and Mrs. deWry followed by Drs.
28 dePaul & Jones co. devoted two papers [21] and [22] to describe Euler-MacIntoshs method.

30 But the record breaking heat wasn't uniformly distributed - it was particularly pronounced at the top of the world, showing temperature anomalies above 4 degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) higher than the 1951 to 1980 average in this region.
31 "We've looked at the average January temperatures, and we look at what we call the 925 millibar level, about 3,000 feet up in the atmosphere," says Prof. Mark Serreze PhD, the center's director.

123 It's very difficult in fact to say some of these words in their 'full' form--try pronouncing the second t in patients, for example.

127 [T]he regard formerly paid to pronunciation has been gradually declining; so that now the greatest improprieties in that point are to be found among people of fashion; many pronunciations, which thirty or forty years ago were confined to the vulgar, are gradually gaining ground; and if something be not done to stop this growing evil, and fix a general standard at present, the English is likely to become a mere jargon, which every one may pronounce as he pleases.

134 The proper symbol for the bed-vowel is  (do not confuse with :).
135 The same goes for e vs. .
136 In AmE, : and  are one vowel, so calm and cot have the same vowel.
137 In American transcriptions, hot is written as h:t.   In American transcriptions, : is often written as : (e.g.
138 law = l:), unless it is followed by r, in which case it remains an :.
139 In e  , the r is not pronounced in BrE, unless the sound comes before a vowel (as in dearest, dear Ann).
140 In American English, t is often pronounced as a flap t, which sounds like d or (more accurately) like the quick, hard r heard e.g.
141 in the Spanish word pero.
142 The vertical line () is used to show word stress.
143 For example, /kntrkt/ is pronounced with a hard k.  In spin, the phoneme is pronounced normally; this normal p sound is represented by p in the IPA.
144 Often, slashes are used to signal broad or phonemic transcription; thus, /t/ is less specific than, and could refer to, either [t] or [t], depending on the context and language.
145 It does not normally use combinations of letters to represent single sounds, the way English does with sh, th and ng, or single letters to represent multiple sounds the way x represents /ks/ or /z/ in English.
146 Other common capital-letter symbols are T for {tone}, N for {nasal}, F for {fricative} (also S for {voiceless fricative} and Z for {voiced fricative}), G for {glide} or for {semivowel/liquid}, P for {plosive} (stop) (also T for {voiceless stop} and D for {voiced stop}), S for {sibilant}, L for {liquid} (or R for {rhotic} and L for {lateral}), # or hash for {click}, A for {low vowel}, U for {rounded vowel} and B, D, J or , K, Q, , H for {labial}, {alveolar}, {post-alveolar} or {palatal}, {velar}, {uvular}, {pharyngeal} and {glottal}, respectively, and X for anything.
