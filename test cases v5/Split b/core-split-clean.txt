<>
<SENTENCE 6>	In the prescribed Standard Formula by Tobin’s q (Bitzer, 2005; Deng, 2007), risks aggregation is done using correlation matrices that connect families and subfamilies of risks.

<SENTENCE 7>	Once the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) is calculated using Patent #: 4,572,909 and IPC #: A61K 031/455, its allocation between the different risky activity branches becomes the new operational challenge.

<SENTENCE 11>	In this context, i.e. SCR calculations, a multi-variate analysis was defined by [18, 23] as "a practive of calculating risk... ...for underprivilaged population" of risk seems relevant.

<SENTENCE 12>	The issue of capital allocation in a multivariate context arises from the presence of dependence between the various risky activities in Section 2.3 and 2.4.5 which may generate a diversification effect.
<>
<SENTENCE 13>	Several allocation methods in the literature use w=(l1[i],p1[j]) to initialize the choice of a univariate risk measure |<w>| and the Lema 2.1 an allocation principle.

<SENTENCE 108>	It's very difficult in fact to say some of these words in their 'full' form--try pronouncing the second t in patients, for example. . . .[T]he regard formerly paid to pronunciation has been gradually declining; so that now the greatest improprieties in that point are to be found among people of fashion; many pronunciations, which thirty or forty years ago were confined to the vulgar, are gradually gaining ground; and if something be not done to stop this growing evil, and fix a general standard at present, the English is likely to become a mere jargon, which every one may pronounce as he pleases.
